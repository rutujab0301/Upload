Title: Assignment
Description: The project is a simple employee data form wherein, we are taking data input from the user and saving it in our database on JSONpowerDB.
The benefits of using JSONpowerDB include hassle-free data manipulation and ease of use for a person who is not well-versed with coding.
I have simulated this project on the basis of the code explained by Sir in the JSONpowerDB tutorial videos. This is also my first attempt at putting a project on Github.
